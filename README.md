# Development of Data Science Framework Pipelining for Public Health using ARIMA

This project focuses on building a robust and reusable data science pipeline tailored to public health data analysis and forecasting using ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) models. It is designed to support disease surveillance, outbreak prediction, and evidence-based public health decision-making.

## üìå Objective

To develop a data-driven framework that:
- Collects and preprocesses public health time series data
- Applies ARIMA modeling for forecasting key health indicators
- Visualizes trends and future predictions
- Supports automated, scalable analysis for real-time public health surveillance

## üîÑ Pipeline Workflow

1. **Data Collection**  
   Sources: Johns Hopkins University COVID-19 Dataset, WHO, CDC, etc.

2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Handling missing values  
   - Time series transformation  
   - Smoothing and stationarization

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Trend, seasonality, and outlier detection  
   - ACF and PACF plots for ARIMA parameter tuning

4. **ARIMA Modeling**  
   - Auto-regressive, integration, and moving average components  
   - Model selection using AIC/BIC and residual diagnostics  
   - Forecasting for defined periods

5. **Evaluation**  
   - Metrics: MAE, RMSE, MAPE  
   - Visual comparison of predictions vs. actuals

6. **Visualization and Reporting**  
   - Interactive dashboards (optional)  
   - Plotly/Matplotlib time series charts

7. **Deployment (Optional)**  
   - Jupyter notebook automation  
   - Web interface or alert system integration
